DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) Version 1.0 and does not apply to any other 3rd 
party tools, utilities or code which may be used to develop this application.

If anyone is aware of any licence violations that this code may be making
please inform the developers so that the issue can be investigated and 
rectified.

Building:
You will need Visual Studio VS2010 with C# and C++, all other software should 
be included with this repository. 

Nant scripts (encapsulated by the build.bat file) are used to build the project 
outside visual studio and will run all unit tests.

To build the code in 32-bit Debug mode just run Build in the root of the 
project folder.

Issues:
Please raise issues on GitHub if you can repeat the issue then please provide a 
sample to make it easier for us to also repeat it and then implement a fix.
Dropbox is very useful for sharing files http://db.tt/VanqFDn

Contribution:
Software is being developed with agile practices in mind e.g. TDD using NUnit 
and Moq for .NET code and GoogleTest for C++ code. So if you are wishing to 
contribute please ensure that tests exist, if possible, for any contributed 
code. 

Project Management:
Currently using AgileZen to organise the project and workflow, however 
you may have to become a member and/or get an invite. Initially I'll grant
view only access to those who are just interested i.e. "Chickens" and grant 
greater rights to those people who wish to, or actively, contribute 
i.e. "Pigs".
