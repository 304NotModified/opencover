- [ ] have looked at the opencover output xml file in an attempt to resolve the issue.
- [ ] reviewed the [current issues](https://github.com/opencover/opencover/issues) to check that the issue isn't already known.

### Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

### Steps to reproduce the problem:

- [ ] reviewed the [usage guide](https://github.com/opencover/opencover/wiki/usage) and [usage document](https://github.com/opencover/opencover/blob/master/main/OpenCover.Documentation/Usage.pdf) again because we know you probably didn't do it the first time.
- [ ] sample code or link to repository/gist is available (support is much, much faster this way)
